# Sudokia
This is a small AI made to solve Sudokus.

## Usage

You can either use `test.py` with the pretrained `model.pth` (might produce weird results) or retrain it yourself using `train.py`.

To run the automated test suite and evaluate the model's performance on multiple puzzles, use the following command:

```
python test_suite.py
```
